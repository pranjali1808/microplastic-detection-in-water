## Handling Large Files with Git LFS

Some project files, such as large ZIP archives containing datasets or trained models, exceed GitHub's 100 MB file size limit. To manage these files efficiently, this repository uses **Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)**.

Git LFS stores large files on a separate server and keeps lightweight pointers in the Git repository.

### Setup Instructions for Cloning

1. Install Git LFS if you haven't already:

   [https://git-lfs.github.com/](https://git-lfs.github.com/)

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pranjali1808/microplastic-detection-in-water.git
